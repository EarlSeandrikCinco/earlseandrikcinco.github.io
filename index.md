## 📋 Features

Our e-commerce application incorporates several key features that explore distributed systems:

- **Distributed Lock**: Prevents race conditions using mechanisms for distributed locking.
  
- **Distributed Transaction**: Manages transactions in multi-service operations using strategies like Saga Pattern and Two-Phase Commit.

- **Distributed Observation**: Implements event sourcing, audit logging, and distributed tracing for better monitoring.

- **Message Queue Patterns**: Utilizes RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging and event-driven architecture.

- **Caching Strategies**: Employs Redis for cache invalidation and distributed caching to enhance speed.

- **Database Problems**: Addresses issues like index optimization, query analysis, connection pooling (HikariCP), and Hibernate performance tuning.

- **Idempotency**: Focuses on idempotent operations and retry mechanisms to improve reliability.

## 🧩 Application Structure 

Once installed, the application consists of several components:

- **User Interface**: A simple, intuitive interface for browsing products.
  
- **Product Management**: Allows users to add, edit, and delete products.

- **Shopping Cart**: Lets users add items to their cart before purchase.
